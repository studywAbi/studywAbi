- 👋 Hi, I’m Abigail 
- 👀 I’m interested in math, physics but also in the development of games especially focused on education.
- 🌱 I’m currently in junior year 
- 💞️ I’m a beginner in the platform so in this moment I not looking for collaborations because if I want to collaborate with someone I would like to give the 100% of myself. 
So while I'm learning how to use the platform of Unity I won't collaborate with anyone. :)
